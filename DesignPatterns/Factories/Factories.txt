Factory - A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.


Motivation:

- Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
- Constructor is not descriptive
	+ Name mandated by name of containing type 
	+ Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
	+ Can turn into 'optional paremeter hell'
- Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to:
	+ A spearate function (Factory Method)
	+ That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
	+ Car create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory
